My expertise lies in developing technical products that delivers value to end users, with a deep understanding of entire SDLC and full-stack development. I thrive in system design, requirements gathering, with strong focus on UX &or; DevX. 

I have experience in leading software engineering teams ensures the consistent delivery of high-quality results, regardless of project/product tech-stack. 

Currently, I'm on sabbatical, expanding my programming skills by coding in JavaScript and TypeScript as a hobby, and learning Rust 🦀
