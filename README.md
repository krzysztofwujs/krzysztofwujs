### Hello, I'm Krzysztof! Welcome to my profile! 🙇

I specialize in developing and delivering technical products, with a deep understanding of the entire lifecycle. I thrive in system design, requirements gathering, and UX/DevX in full-stack development. My expertise in leading agile teams ensures the consistent delivery of high-quality results, regardless of projects tech-stack. 

Currently, I'm on sabbatical, expanding my programming skills by learning JavaScript and TypeScript as a hobby, and diving into the world of Rust 🦀
