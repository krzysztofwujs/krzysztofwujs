# Hi, I'm Krzysztof 👋

**Product & Delivery | Tech-agnostic Builder | Digital Identity & Zero Knowledge | DevX & Smart Contracts | AI Agents**

I work at the intersection of **product, deep tech and decentralized systems**.  
My focus is on building usable, secure and developer-friendly experiences around:

- **Digital Identity & SSI**
- **Zero Knowledge proofs (ZK)**
- **Smart Contracts & security models**
- **Developer Experience (DevX)**
- **AI Agents & automation**
- **Tech-agnostic product delivery**

---

## 🔭 What I'm currently exploring
- AI-driven developer tooling & agents  
- Practical ZK applications (identity, verification, privacy-preserving flows)  
- UX & DevX patterns for smart contract platforms  
- Intersections of identity, verifiable computing and trust systems  

---

## 🧪 Selected projects / learning playgrounds
- ZK frameworks and languages (Noir, o1js, Circom)  
- Move, Solidity & smart contract templates  
- Experiments with identity wallets and verifiable credentials  
- AI agent architectures for technical workflows
