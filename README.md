### Hey, I am Krzysztof. Welcome to my profile! ðŸ™‡

I know my way around product development and delivery, and I enjoy working on gathering requirements for software products. With a background in systems design, UX/DevX, and full-stack development, Iâ€™m currently rediscovering my love for programming by working on JavaScript/TypeScript projects as a hobby and learning Rust. ðŸ¦€

## My current research interests include:

	â€¢	ZK interactions in Web3
	â€¢	On-Chain gaming and Web3 e-sports
	â€¢	Self-sovereign identity and data privacy
